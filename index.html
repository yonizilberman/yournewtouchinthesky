				<p class="global">
					located in one of the most prominent and over populated regions on the planet, Beijing Capital International airport is the second busiest airport in the world. Every day, 100000 business men and women, travellers and immigrants, pass through the airport's doors on their way to a new adventure.
				</p>
				<p class="global">
					A stroll in the lounge area reveals an eclectic assemblage of cultures from across the globe, making one feel a part of a globalised civilisation. BCIA’s logo is intended to manifest the lounge area case, where people from different countries and backgrounds randomly meet in one public space, and in this case, in one logo.

				<p class="how"> 
					Similar to the airport's dynamics, the logo is comprised of thousands of quickly alternating fingerprints, coming and going from one destination to the other. These fingerprints are, in fact, the actual fingerprints of the airport's populace given in real-time by the airport's biometric system.
				</p>
				<p class="how"> 
					Every time a person arrives at BCIA, he uses his fingerprint as an identification proof, which then grants him permission to enter the country. Simultaneously, the fingerprint is stylised to be featured for one second in BCIA’s logo, which is projected across the airport and in the Wide Web.

			<section id="fameContent" class="bubble">
				<p id="fame">
					In times when ethnicity and cultural heritage lose their relevance in our global village, biometrics can provide a sense of insectionidual visual identity. BCIA's logo thus strives to compensate for the passerby’s anonymity, and reduced sense of “self” by imprinting his distinguishable fingerprint, therefore giving him “a moment of fame”.

				<p id="urban">
					Departing from Asia’s urban planning, I tried to create an image that sets out from the centre, outwards. Therefore, the challenge in abstracting a city’s map was to decide which streets and paths to eliminate, and which to emphasise. My principal concern was to not lose the urban aesthetics and arrangement while simplifying the image.

				<p id="finger">
					There are three types of fingerprints: Loop, Arch and Whorl. After identifying the heart of every fingerprint, I marked the dominant ridges to correlate them with the city’s core paths. Subsequently, I continued to dissect the chief routs into smaller ones, forming small alleyways
